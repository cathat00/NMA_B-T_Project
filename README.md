# 🧠 Neuromatch Behavior + Theory Project, 2025

Collaborative RNN + Python project for Neuromatch Academy.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Open our notebook in Colab: [main_notebook.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/github/cathat00/NMA_B-T_Project/blob/main/notebooks/main_notebook.ipynb)
2. Run the first code cell to load helper modules.
3. Work inside Colab as usual!

## 📦 Project Structure

- `/notebooks/`: Where we run experiments
- `/modules/`: Reusable code like our RNN class or plotting helpers

## 🛠️ Updating Modules

1. Create your own branch
2. Go to the module folder
3. Select a file and click ✏️ (Edit)
4. Commit changes to your branch
5. In Colab, restart the session and rerun the first cell to get the latest version
6. We can merge changes into main during project time
