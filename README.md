# üß† Neuromatch Behavior + Theory Project, 2025

Collaborative project for Neuromatch Academy.\

## üß™ Notebooks
- [Baseline](https://colab.research.google.com/github/cathat00/NMA_B-T_Project/blob/main/notebooks/main_notebook.ipynb)
- [Adding More Targets](https://colab.research.google.com/github/cathat00/NMA_B-T_Project/blob/calebs_branch/notebooks/more_targets.ipynb)

## üöÄ How to Run

1. Open one of our notebooks in Colab.
2. Run the first code cell to load helper modules.
3. Work inside Colab as usual!

## üì¶ Project Structure

- `/notebooks/`: Where we run experiments
- `/modules/`: Reusable code like our RNN class or plotting helpers

## üõ†Ô∏è Updating Modules

1. Create a new branch ("Branches" -> "View All Branches" -> "New Branch")
2. Select ("checkout") your branch via the branch dropdown
3. Go to the module folder
4. Select a file and click ‚úèÔ∏è (Edit)
5. Commit changes to your branch
6. In Colab, restart the session and rerun the first cell to get the latest version
7. We can merge your changes into main during project time!
